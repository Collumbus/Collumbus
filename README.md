### What's up?! 👋

I'm a Business Intelligence Analyst at [GeekHunter](https://www.geekhunter.com.br/). There I work with data analysis and data structure development.
- 🔭  I’m currently currently working on business intelligence challenges and structuring a Data Mesh using Airflow, RDS, S3, Glue, Athena and some APIs to gather different data sources.
- 🌱 Now, I'm learning some data science structure stuff like Data lake, Data Mesh and Big data using AWS Tools, Airflow and Pandas.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on data science and machine learning projects.
