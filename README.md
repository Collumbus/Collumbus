# What's up?!  👋

I'm a Data Engineer at [National Bank of Canada](https://www.bnc.ca/). There I work with data pipelines and data structure development.

- 🔭 I’m currently tackling data architecture challenges and structuring a Data Mesh using Airflow, RDS, S3, Glue, Athena, Lambda, StepFunction, DynamoDB, and various APIs to integrate different data sources.
- 🌱 I’m continuously learning about data science structures such as Data Lakes, Data Mesh, and Big Data using AWS Tools, Airflow, Terraform, Jenkins, and Pandas.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on data science and machine learning projects, leveraging my expertise in Python, Spark, and AWS services.
- 💡 Passionate about delivering value through data-driven insights and optimizing systems to handle large volumes of data.
